# Woo-Cat-Spartan
<strong>Required Plugins</strong><br>
Woocommerce<br>
Elementor Pro or Divi Theme <br>
Revolution Slider<br>

I have created a WordPress plugin for woocommerce websites named "Woo Cat Spartan". This plugin allows you to add featured, recent, top-rated and sale products on woocommerce product category pages. You can also add a category-specific revolution slider on product category pages. It means every category page will have its separate revolution slider. Use Elementor Pro to customize woocommerce product category template and play with "Woo Cat Spartan" shortcodes.
Woo Cat Spartan is currently in beta version. It supports English and Urdu language only.
